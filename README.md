Hi there 👋 My name is Vinícius
==========================

Trainee Software Developer
-----------------------------

I am a 23 year old developer and discovered the world of codes in my last year of Civil Engineering and at that moment I saw how incredible it was to solve deep problems using cutting edge technology. 

My main focus now is to understand in general what the world of technology has to offer in the job market. Now, I'm learning Go Lang, Docker and Javascript programming language.
